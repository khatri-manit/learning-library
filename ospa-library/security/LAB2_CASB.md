**Disclaimer:  This lab is designed ONLY for large learning groups and assumes the groups are sharing the Oracle Cloud environment to execute this lab.**


## Mama Maggy's security monitoring business needs for SaaS and OCI

Shannon Kim, Director/Manager of IT is seeking to improve the security monitoring capabilities across On-Premise and Cloud services.
Security Operation Center is overwhelmed because of the number of alerts receive daily. They are barely able to respond on time and proactively identify a threat.
Security might sound as a stopper for the users, but she needs to introduce a solution that helps both, Line-of-Business and IT to keep the environment safe, available and without introducing radical changes to the user experience.
The organization needs to shift from a reactive to a proactive approach. That's why Mamma Maggy as opts for Oracle CASB Cloud Service. CASB Keeps enterprises secure by automating responses to threats with forensics, incident management, orchestration and remediation through native capabilities as well as integration with existing technologies.
Security evolves to become a business enabler and she knows that the best fit to meet this requirement is Oracle CASB Cloud Service.
Her team is on its way of implementing CASB to monitor SaaS applications and OCI. You as the SOC Manager have to integrate these services with the solution and put them ready to reduce no only the amount of alerts received, but human intervention.



## Module 1:  Logging to CASB Community Tenant

**Who Should Complete This Lab:  All Participants**


*	We are purposefully using our “Community” tenant instead of the tenant associated with the Cloud Account. 
*	The “Community” tenant is a persistent sandbox environment where Oracle employees can try out CASB features.
* Let’s register ourselves and become a member of the “Community”. Open your browser to the CASB “trial” pod: https://trial.palerra.net.
* Login to CASB using the Tenant admin account

**NOTE: Tenant User id and Password will be delivered by the instructor**

![CASB Console](./media/casb_login1.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 1-1 </p>  

* Click the following in sequence as shown in the image to navigate to the administration dashboard

![CASB Console](./media/casb_login2.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 1-2 </p>

*	Add your First, Last and email address (highlighted in yellow). Leave Role as “Tenant Admin” and click “Save”. 

![CASB Console](./media/casb_login3.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 1-3 </p>


* You should receive an email within a few minutes.

![CASB Console](./media/casb_login3.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 1-4 </p>

* Now you are CASB Tenant administrator. Use your recently created account to login to Oracle CASB Cloud Service


## Module 2:  Create and monitor a sanctioned application

The following hands-on labs assume that you are familiar with Oracle Cloud Platform console navigation, as well as access to Oracle CASB Cloud Service console.
In order to ease the process, we recommend using two separate browsers or windows.
We will enroll third-party services as part of the exercises and it's requires to navigate back and forth between CASB and the vendors' dashboards to complete the lab.

For the purpose of this workshop, you will be using Oracle CASB community tenant which you may use indefinitely for whatever CASB features you’d like to try for yourself.

**NOTE: CASB is a dynamic service that is, by design, constantly in flux. As a result, what you see in the console may not match exactly with the lab screenshots. Screenshots are provided solely for illustrative purposes to help guide you directionally through the CASB console.**

For consistency and for the ease of use-cases implementation, you will use a personal **email account (e.g. Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) to sign-up for your Salesforce and Box developer instances**, and for CASB application registration you will use the following naming convention:

`COSE_location+room_appName_GroupNumber` *(e.g. **COSE_AU1_Salesforce_G1**, **COSE_AU1_Salesforce_G2**)*


Following this name convention will help us to clean up the environment once the lab is completed.

****
## Monitoring SaaS applications
Oracle CASB monitors your sanctioned applications after a simple registration process. This enables you to manage risk events from a centralized platform instead of having to monitor the individual application to remediate security threats. Oracle CASB monitors risk events such as blacklisted IP addresses, anomalous user behavior and unwanted security configurations in the application.
As part of this first part of the module, we will enroll two applications used broadly by our customers base. The main goal of this section of the lab is to guide you through the process of configuring the applications to later integrate them with CASB.

### Registering a Box instance (Push Security Controls Mode) - Who Should Complete This Lab:  1 Participant for group

**NOTE: Due to capacity constraints, We will group individuals on teams of three to register the application in CASB. Instructor will provide group numbers. During the registration process learners must use the following name convention COSE_First-Two-letters-of-the location_APP_Group] (e.g. COSE_AU1_BOX_G1, COSE_AU2_BOX_G2)**

* You will add or register your Box instance to Oracle CASB Cloud Service to be monitored, and with the capability to push security configuration settings.
To register a Box instance with the Oracle CASB Cloud Service, you need the user ID (email address) and password that belongs to a Box administrator with the appropriate privileges in the account that you want to monitor. This user must be dedicated to the Oracle CASB Cloud Service. We will use the co-admin user that we created in the previous steps.

* In push security controls mode, Oracle CASB Cloud Service checks various security control values in the Box instance, and sets them to the values that you set at registration time. Later, you receive notifications when these security configuration settings change.

* Oracle CASB Cloud Service monitors these settings in Box:

  * Password policies, authentication policies, and session settings: These are in the Box business settings page, Security tab.
  * Settings: These additional security settings are in the Box business settings page, Content & Sharing tab.


* Login to your Cloud dashboard and open Oracle CASB Cloud Service console
* Select Applications from the Navigation menu.

## Module 4:  Oracle CASB Monitoring Oracle Cloud Infrastructure


Oracle CASB has the broadest support of infrastructure as cloud services (IaaS). It enables you to monitor infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Infrastructure Cloud (OCI). With Oracle CASB you can monitor all layers of your IT.
 
To monitor OCI, CASB requires credentials with the appropriate OCI access. This section explains how to complete these steps. To accomplish this you’ll first need to create an account, group and policy within OCI. As a part of those steps you will require a signed RSA key.
 
Once you have the OCI credentials, then you’ll register the OCI tenant within Oracle CASB for monitoring. Please follow the steps below to complete the registration process.

### **DEMO** - Register OCI tenant

* Open a new tab on your browser and go to the Oracle CASB dashboard

* Select Applications from the Navigation menu in the upper left corner ![](./media/image2.png)

* Click Add/Modify App

* Select OCI and Click Next (bottom right corner of the screen)

  ![](./media/image96.jpeg)
  <p align="center"> Figure 4-13 </p> 

* Enter unique name into the field for your OCI instance. Then click Next

![](./media/image97.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 4-14 </p> 

* As you can see, you can add three types of OCI instances in Oracle CASB Cloud Service, based on the type of OCI compartment that is monitored:

![](./media/image98.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 4-15 </p> 

  - **OCI Tenancy** - the root compartment that contains all of your
    organization's compartments and other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    cloud resources. Everything in all compartments and sub-compartments
    is monitored.

  - **Compartment under a registered Tenancy** - a specified compartment
    under a registered OCI tenancy. Only the collection of related
    resources within the specified compartment, which are accessible
    only by certain groups that have been given permission by an
    administrator in your organization, are monitored.

  When you register a compartment inside a tenancy that is already
  registered in Oracle CASB Cloud Service, the compartment inherits
  access credentials from the parent tenancy, so you only have to
  specify the compartment name.

  - **A Standalone Compartment** – an OCI compartment that is accessed
    directly, without first registering the OCI tenancy in Oracle CASB
    Cloud Service. As with a compartment under a registered tenancy,
    only the collection of related resources within the specified
    compartment, which are accessible only by certain groups that have
    been given permission by an administrator in your organization, are
    monitored.

  In our case, we will select the first option.

* Go to OCI

* Copy Tenancy OCID and paste into Tenancy OCID field.

* To get the tenancy OCID from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, go to the Tenancy Details page:

  Open the navigation menu, under Governance and Administration, go to **Administration** and click **Tenancy Details.**
  
  ![](./media/image99.jpeg)
  <p align="center"> Figure 4-16 </p> 
  
  The tenancy OCID is shown under **Tenancy Information**. Click **Copy** to copy it to your clipboard.
  
  ![](./media/image100.jpeg)
  <p align="center"> Figure 4-17 </p>

## Module 7:  **DEMO** Data Loss Protection

 
Oracle CASB’s Data Loss Protection (DLP) scans and detects files in sanctioned application for sensitive data that follows a defined information type pattern in a rule. Oracle CASB can then manage the situation by tagging the detected files as containing sensitive data, quarantining the files in folders that only administrators can access or completely delete the files from the application. It’s easy to use and has the flexibility to define any
type of data that needs to be detected and secured.
In this you’ll see how Oracle CASB is able to detect sensitive information in a managed document in your Box account.

### **DEMO** - Config Data Loss Protection in CASB

*  Click to Configuration DLP Management

![](./media/image122.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 7-1 </p>

*  Click Add Rule

![](./media/image123.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 7-2 </p>

*  In the first section Content, select the Information Types box and –Top Secret- Keyword and click Next.
    
![](./media/image124.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 7-3 </p>

*  In the second section Remediation, select the options shown below and click Next. This section describes the action to take after the selected content is detected. In this case, the document will be classified as highly confidential, an alert will be created and the document will be quarantined (the document will be moved to a path only accessible by the administrator)

![](./media/image125.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 7-4 </p>

*  In the last section, enter the following parameters and click Save.
![](./media/image126.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 7-5 </p>

*  Now your rule should appear in the list of DLP rules.
